# AssitAI - a ChatGPT plugin for Eclipse IDE

This project is an eclipse IDE plugin that allows integration with ChatGPT. 
The plugin is still very experimental, and it only works with Java editors.

## Main features

1. You can ask ChatGPT to refactor a selected portion of your code
2. You can ask ChatGPT to write a JavaDoc for the selected class or method
3. You cna ask ChatGPT to write a JUnit test for the selected class or method

You can also ask a question, just like with a regular ChatGPT.
